Continuations example in "C" which can be used to implement async-only single threaded request servers over the age-old poll and multi-threaded dispatch mechanism.

Currently supported for x86_64 and i386 because of the way the closure is implemented which makes it arch. dependent.

Check out continuation_test_1.c for sample usage.
